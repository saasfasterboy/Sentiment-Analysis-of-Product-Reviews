Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
Overview
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze customer feedback and provide insights into customer sentiments.

Features
Data Collection: Gather product reviews from various e-commerce platforms.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) to classify sentiments.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Generate visualizations to illustrate sentiment distributions and model performance.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
NLTK / SpaCy
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
